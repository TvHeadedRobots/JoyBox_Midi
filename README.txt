JoyBox_MIDI Platform
A extensible Joystick MIDI controller platform

By: TvHeadedRobots

JoyBox_MIDI was created using the Arduino platform and is intended to be a mutable, 
extensible MIDI controller platform using a joystick and button for input. It can send
any type of MIDI message, like CC, Note On, Note Off, sysex, etc with some help from
the Arduino MIDI library. It is intended to be a platform for developing your own
controller ideas around the available inputs.
